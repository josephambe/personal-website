# About

**This is a personal website I made to keep track of my projects and events I've been to.**

**I based this website on the gastbsy-starter-stellar template.**


## To Do

Everything

## Installation

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
<br>
`gatsby new gatsby-starter-stellar https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-stellar`

Run `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start the dev site.
