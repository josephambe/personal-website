            Virtual Realities Hackathonn was held as part of TechWeek Wellington 2017. I was way underqualified, easily the youngest there in age and experience by at least five years, but was super excited because they basically gave you a load of sweet tech to play with for a weekend.
            < br />< br />
            The theme of the hackathon was VR/AR with a focus on combining the real world and the virtual world together to educate, experiment, and solve some big issues.
            < br />< br />
            The new Theta HoloLens was what immediately drew my attention and I ended up in a team with Jim Taylor from Theta who was responsible for bringing that particular HoloLens to the party. This was awesome because it meant that I could learn from an expert in the field. On our team was also Marianne Malmstrom of Newlands Intermediate School who had experience using virtual environments in her classes.
            < br />< br />
            This combination of experiences led us to our product of the weekend; a VR minecraft environment that enabled kids to build their worlds virtually, collaboratively, solving problems and exploring together beyond the screens.
            < br />< br />
            In the end, I pitched a portion of the idea on behalf of our team and the judges were convinced! We won! Whohoo! As far as first hackathons go, it was a success. The biggest learning curve for me was that in such a short frame of time, you canâ€™t achieve everything you originally planned to do. But being able to create something, and explore new ideas, learn new skills, are all part of what makes it (in my mind) a successful weekend, winners or not.
